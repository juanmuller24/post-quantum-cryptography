# post-quantum-cryptography
QSocket is a proof-of-concept Python project that demonstrates secure, quantum-resistant communication between a client and a server. It uses a hybrid cryptographic approach, combining classical elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) with post-quantum Kyber KEM, to ensure both present and future security against quantum attacks.
